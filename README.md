# Capstone Project 6: Polynomial Regression

A simple polynomial regression using South African Covid-19 data

### Topics Covered
* Pandas
* Numpy
* ScikitLearn
* Matplotlib

### What the app can do

* The app trains a polynomial regression model and fits a line of best fit to the data.
* Prediction data is then compared to test data to determine the "goodness-of-fit" of the trained model/line.
